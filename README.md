This is a program to see the kits of users in the game Battlefield 1. It uses the API created by https://trnbattlefield.docs.apiary.io/# to access user data and creates a visual representation of a player's loadout for all classes and vehicles.

Currently a work-in-progress, developed to help me learn development in Ruby on Rails.

Live version of program can be found at https://tliss-battlekitten.herokuapp.com/kit_lists/1
